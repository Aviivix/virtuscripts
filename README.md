# VirtuScripts
A set of QoL Tampermonkey scripts designed for use on VirtuPets. Most of these are rather crude, as I am SHIT at JavaScript. But, I use them for me, and so they may be useful for you. If you have a request, let me know what you're looking to do and I'll see if I can make you something.

These scripts are all [b]cosmetic scripts[/b] that will only add information to pages, and none of them will automate anything for you. [b]Modifying these scripts to make them automate things is against VirtuPets rules and will almost certainly get your account frozen.[/b]
